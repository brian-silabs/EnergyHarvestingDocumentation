<img src="images/zcrdisplay_000.png" alt="" width="800" class="center">

This repository holds documentation and implementation on how to create a Zigbee Combo Router with SINK for the ZGP light sensor example  

In order to proceed, you will need to download EmberZNet SDK through Simplicity Studio
The SDK's access can only be requested using the serial number coming from this development kit :
[SLWSTK6000B](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/zigbee/efr32mg-zigbee-thread-starter-kit)

At the time of writing, this is done using Simplicity Studio v5 and GSDK 3.1.0

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

## Description ##
This code is running on a SLWRB4180A and uses the display of its SLWMB4001 mother board to show Light sensor measurement.
It can be commissioned to any Zigbee 3.0 network or can form one for the demo.  

To pair and use it, follow the steps described in the section *"Running the example"*
